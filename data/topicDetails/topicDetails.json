He said, ‘I just need you to know: When you married into this family, we rejoiced in the streets the same we did when Mandela was freed from prison,’” she said during an interview with The Cut. The Daily Mail revealed Dr John Kani, who claims he was the only South African actor in the film, said he did not attend the premiere and had never met the Duchess of Sussex. \"I have never met Meghan Markle,\" he told the MailOnline. \"This seems like something of a faux pas by her. I have I have never met the duchess at all. I am the only South African member of the cast and I did not attend the premiere in London. \"The only South African was me playing Rafiki. But I did not go to the opening in Leicester Square as I didn't have the time to do that.

      "details": "Lando Norris asks Max Verstappen to lend him the 2022 Dutch GP trophy as he predicts the Dutchman as a sure winner. Max Verstappen returns to his home Grand Prix in Zandvoort for the 2022 Dutch GP. And it seems like the Dutchman will enjoy another easy victory this weekend. Max has a 93-point advantage in the drivers’ championship over Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc ahead of the race. And at this rate, Max can cruise comfortably, to claim his 2nd Championship title this season. But Max does not want to lose his focus and momentum ahead of his home GP. He wants to claim his 10th win of the season in front of his home crowd in style. Recently, the Dutch GP unveiled a rather unique-looking trophy. And McLaren driver Lando Norris liked the new trophy.   a journalist asks lando if he likes the dutch gp trophy and if it will be his on sunday: “no, it’s max’s. everyone knows it’s max’s already. maybe max will give it to me, he has plenty.” i love lando norris and max verstappen friendship pic.twitter.com/LQh9cnwjLv — comfort lando norris (@safeforlando) August 31, 2022 The Brit was grabbing a bicycle in the F1 paddock when he was interviewed by Dutch press personnel. Norris was asked what he thought of the Dutch Grand Prix trophy. Norris replied, “Oh I loved it.” But he admitted he would not be able to take the trophy home. He said, “No, it’s Max’s. Everyone knows it’s Max’s already. Maybe he will give it to me, he has plenty.” Seems like Norris is not alone. As it is becoming more obvious amongst the drivers that the Dutch GP trophy has Max’s name written on it. And with a win this Sunday, even the Championship might have Max’s name for a second time.

And he would like to pay tribute to his father, Jos Verstappen who coached him during his karting days and developed him as a racing driver. Jos has also served as a manager for Max. Jos was an F1 driver who raced in F1 from 1994 to 2003. He has 106 race starts with no wins and he raced for a variety of teams from Benetton, Arrows, Tyrell and Honda. And for the Dutch GP, Max would be wearing a helmet that resembles the one worn by his father.

But I think it’s just really special to drive something like this because it’s also how I started in go-karting.” He added, “All the old pictures I have of go-karting are with this iconic design. So that’s why we thought it was a great idea to bring this back alive around Zandvoort.” Jos has never won a race in his F1 career. But wearing this helmet, Max might win his 10th race of the season and cement his name on the Championship trophy.
